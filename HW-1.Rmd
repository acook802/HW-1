## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Jacob Dixon and Andrew Holtz
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: ~12 hours
* What gave you the most trouble: Figuring how to represent data and how much analysis to perform on each question.
* Any comments you have: This was a LOT of time and work dealing with small small things. I felt like the amount of time I had to put in was disproportionate to what I was getting out of it. 





## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flights_per_day <- flights %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  dplyr::rename(flights_per_day = n)

# find number of flights delayed by >30 min on each day
delayed_flights_per_day <- flights %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay >30) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  dplyr::rename(delayed_flights_per_day = n)

# join data sets and compute the proportion of delayed flights per day
prop_delayed_flights <- inner_join(flights_per_day, delayed_flights_per_day, by="date") %>% 
                        mutate(prop = round(delayed_flights_per_day/flights_per_day,3))

#organize flights by season
prop_delayed_flights <- prop_delayed_flights %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date))

#tell R which months are in which seasons
winter <- c(12, 1, 2)
spring <- c(3, 4, 5)
summer <- c(6, 7, 8)
autumn <- c(9, 10, 11)

prop_delayed_flights <- prop_delayed_flights %>% 
  mutate(season = ifelse(month %in% winter, 'winter', 
                         ifelse(month %in% spring, 'spring', 
                                ifelse(month %in% summer, 'summer', 
                                       ifelse(month %in% autumn, 'autumn', NA)))))

#plot proportion of delayed flights
ggplot(data=prop_delayed_flights, aes(x = date, y = prop, colour = season)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Flights Delayed by More than 30 Minutes Each Day") +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Proportion of Flights Delayed for > 30 Minutes")

# too much noise, plot by season instead
ggplot(data = prop_delayed_flights, aes(x = season, y = prop)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Flights Delayed by More than 30 Minutes by Season", 
       x = "Season", y = "Proportion of Flights Delayed for > 30 Minutes")

# table
datatable(prop_delayed_flights  %>% group_by(season)  %>% summarise(mean_prop_delays = round(mean(prop), 3)))
```

### Delays of greater than 30 minutes are most common in the Summer
Flights during the Summer months (June, July, August) had overall higher proportions of flight delays of over 30 minutes when compared to other seasons. A plot of counts of daily flights delays over 30 minutes shows an aggregate increase in delays during the summer months, and the corresponding boxplot and table corroborate this trend. The boxplot shows the distribution of delayed flights around the mean for each season. According to this plot, Summer is the most likely time to experience a delay, while Autumn is the least likely time to experience a delay. This could be due to the fact that Summer in the South is associated with extreme weather events such as hurricanes, while the Autumn is relatively mild in comparison. Therefore, if you are hoping to avoid a delay of more than 30 minutes out of Houston, Autumn flights are the best time to travel, followed by Winter flights, Spring flights, and finally Summer flights.





## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# join planes with flights by "plane" to match plane to airline
# left join to preserve all flights
flights_and_planes <- left_join(flights, planes, by = "plane")

# plot histograms for each airline
# density shows proportionality rather than counts
ggplot(data=flights_and_planes, aes(year)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) +
  facet_wrap(~carrier, nrow=3) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Fleet Age by Carrier", x = "Year of Plane Model", y = "Proportion of Fleet") 

#organized by boxplot
ggplot(data=flights_and_planes, aes(x = carrier, y = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Plane Age by Airline Carrier", x = "Carrier", y = "Year of Plane Model")

#table: number of planes by carrier for each year
datatable(flights_and_planes  %>%  distinct(plane) %>% group_by(carrier, year)  %>% tally())

#table: average age of plane by airline
avg_plane_age <- flights_and_planes %>% 
  select(carrier, year) %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>% 
  summarise(mean = round(mean(year),0)) %>% 
  arrange(mean)


datatable(avg_plane_age)
```

### Passengers who prefer older planes should take American Airlines
Preliminary data analysis indicates that the majority of Envoy Air's planes were built in either 1974 or 1983, however, in reality, this only accounts for two of Envoy Air's planes. 224 Envoy planes did not have information about the model and year of plane associated with them, so it is possible that the vast majority of Envoy Air flights are on newer planes. According to the boxplot and accompanying data table, American Airlines has the most definitively older fleet, with many outliers made previous to 1980. 11402 planes were omitted in the boxplot and in calculating the mean age of fleets due to the fact that they did not have information about the model and year made associated with them. The boxplots give an indication of the range of age of each carrier's fleet, as well as the distribution. This could inform fliers of how likely they are to get an older fleet, given the size of the fleet and range of model years. Overall, if you are looking to fly on an older plane, American Airlines is the best airline to fly. The next best airline to fly is Delta, however, based on the data table that shows how many planes of each year each carrier has, Delta has been acquiring a few planes every year or so--which skews their fleet newer and increases your likelihood of flying on a newer plane as compared with American Airlines. 




## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# join flights and airports to determine states

```

### Southwest Airlines flies from Houston to other Texas airports most frequently
By any measure, the majority of Southwest Airlines flights leaving from Houston serve other Texas airports. This overwhelming lead is followed by flights to Florida in every measure, after which, flights to other states taper off gently. The distribution is largely skewed towards the states with the most Southwest Airlines service. In a measure of all Southwest flights out of Houston for the year of 2011, 17230 out of 45343 total flights were to other Texas airports. The additional analyses of Southwest flights include a heatmap of flights by state, where darker purple corresponds with more flights, as well as Southwest flights organized by distinct flight numbers and distinct flight routes. A number of flights are accounted for as NA or blank in each of the analyses. This is due to the fact that one airport (ECP) does not have airport location information associated with it. Upon further research, this airport, Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, is located in Florida, so all NA's can be attributed to Florida. This does not effect Florida's ranking as the second most frequent destination of Southwest flights out of Houston. In the analyses of distinct flights and distinct airports, 581 unique flight numbers provide service to seven Texas airports. 





## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# look at categorical conditions 
# join by both date and hour
flights_and_weather <- left_join(flights, weather, by = c("date", "hour"))

#group flights by weather condition
flights_and_weather <- flights_and_weather %>% group_by(conditions)

#plot boxplot
ggplot(data = flights_and_weather, aes(x = conditions, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Delay Length by Weather Condition", x = "Condition", y = "Departure Delay (minutes)")

#deletes 118,212 rows, 4,000 of which are NAs and the rest are negative values
#table of average delays for each condition
avg_delay_weather <- flights_and_weather %>% 
  group_by(conditions) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delay = round(mean(dep_delay),3)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_delay))

datatable(avg_delay_weather)
```

### Freezing rain causes considerable flight delays
Based on analysis of weather conditions and associated delays, it is clear that freezing rain correlates considerably with much longer and less variable delays than any other weather condition. These delays extend to light freezing rain, which has a much larger distribution of delays. The weather conditions that cause the next longest delays are light thunderstorms and rain, yet average delays for these conditions are only 28.643 minutes as compared with 3.65 hours for freezing rain and 1.302 hours for light freezing rain. Conditions that were associated with the shortest delays include light drizzle, shallow fog, and patches of fog. It is odd that flights with the shortest delays did not include clear or even partly cloudy conditions, however, this could be due to confounding weather conditions such as wind or barometric pressure that are not accounted for in this boxplot. This boxplot is displayed on a log scale to incorporate the wide range of delays each weather condition accounts for. The log transformed boxplots do not include departure delays with negative values (i.e. the plane took off before it was scheduled to), or flights that had no departure delay or weather condition data. According to these results, it is best to avoid freezing rain at all costs when flying, and most other weather conditions will scarcely be associated with delays of over ten minutes.





## Question 5:

I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flight_region <- left_join(flights_and_airports, states, by = "state") %>% 
                  mutate(month = month(date))


flights_per_region <- flight_region %>% 
  filter(month == 7) %>% 
  group_by(region, carrier) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  dplyr::rename(num_flights = n)


ggplot(data = flights_per_region, aes(x= carrier, y = num_flights, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="fill") +
  labs(title = "Flights by Carrier in July of 2011", x = "Carrier", y = "Proportion of Flights") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Region", labels = c("Midwest", "Northeast", "South", "West"))

```

### Regional flights vary by carrier in July
20548 total flights left Houston on 15 different carriers in July, 2011. Some carriers served only one region--American Airlines (south), Alaska Airlines (West), JetBlue (Northeast), Frontier Airlines (West), Airtran Airways (South), and Mesa Airlines (South)--while others (Continental, Delta, ExpressJet, Envoy Air, SkyWest, United, US Airways, and Southwest) served airports nationwide. Gray areas on the plot indicate flights that did not have a state associated with the destination airport. Again, these flights can be attributed to Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, and thus are still flights to a southern airport. Overall, this information can help fliers determine which carriers serve the regions they are traveling to, and inform them of airlines that are more likely to serve smaller airports or fly to specific regions more regularly.
